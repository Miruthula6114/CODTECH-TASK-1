 OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
 
PROJECT TITLE : LED Blinking with Arduino

DESCRIPTON :
As part of my internship at CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS, I completed a foundational embedded systems project involving LED blinking using Arduino. This task focused on understanding and implementing basic hardware control through microcontroller programming. The project involved writing and uploading code to the Arduino board to control the LED's on/off state at set intervals, demonstrating key concepts such as digital output, timing functions, and basic circuit design.

SKILLS USED :

Arduino IDE
Embedded C/C++
Circuit Prototyping
